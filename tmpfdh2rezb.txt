Hmm. The first candidate of the day and he is already late. Excuse me? Hi, I'm Leo. I'm here for the 9 o'clock interview. You should have knocked on the door before you come in. Yeah, I was in a hurry. I know. It is 9.15 am already. I was supposed to be on time, but it was rush hour. But I think it is not too late. Anyway, you are here. We will start the interview now. Have a seat, please. Sure. Thank you. Okay, first of all, I would like to introduce myself. Okay. I'm Amelia from the Human Resource Department. I will be your interviewer today. I hope that the interview will go well. It must be. Do you have the CV with you? Can I take a look at it? I sent it to you so I thought I don't need to bring it. Okay. So can you introduce yourself? Hmm. Didn't you read my resume? I sent it a week ago. I know that. Anyway, let's talk about your weakness. I can't think of any right now. Maybe I don't have any weaknesses. By the way, it is not good to let others know about your weakness. Okay. So why do you choose Texas Tech? Well, your company is near my house. I can wake up a bit later. Also, I found good reviews about your company. And then I apply. Can you tell me the reasons why we should hire you? Isn't it obvious? I am looking for a job and you need an experienced employee. And here I am. Why not? One minute please. Okay. Where were we? You know, I think that's okay. Thank you for your time today. Do you have any questions for me? Don't you need to ask about my work experience or something? That's on your resume, isn't it? Right. Now you know how to work. Okay. The result will be sent by email. Thank you. Send it soon. I have the mood to go to work right now. Come in please. Hi, I'm Grayson. I have an interview today for the developer position. Oh, you arrived so early. Your interview is at 11, right? Yeah, I don't want to be late. Please, take a seat. I'm Amelia from the Human Resource Department. I will be your interviewer today. I hope that the interview will go well. Nice to meet you. Here is my CV. Great. Okay, let's start. We sent you the job description for the developer position. I hope you have time to research it. I read it. One time. Is that okay? Okay, tell me about your experience as a developer, please. I am a developer. I mean, I learned. Take it easy. Don't be nervous. I'm so sorry. Would you like to have a cup of water? Yes, please. Thank you. Here you go. Just relax. Thank you. I graduated with an IT degree two years ago. But I worked in a logistics company after graduating. Are you good at JavaScript? I have learned it for over a year. But I haven't actually done any project with it. But that's the main subject that we need. You know it. From what I learned, I think I can do that. Well, okay. Can you tell me about your weakness? Hmm. I think that I find it hard to work under pressure. I hope to have a comfortable working environment. Tell me three reasons why we should choose you. I'm honest. I'm friendly. And I'm a hard worker. Okay. Thank you for your time today. Do you have any questions? I think I don't. Thanks. I will send the results and feedback via email. Look forward to hearing from you soon. Why do you look so sad? I'm looking for a developer for our company. But it is hard, you know. I thought you had some interviews today. Yeah, I did. Didn't they go well? Not at all. The first candidate showed up late with no apology. He entered the room without knocking on the door. He was so impolite. He wore shorts to the interview. I can't believe it. What happened then? Yeah. And his attitude was bad. I can't imagine working with a person like him. He didn't respect the interviewer and his words were informal. He even used his phone when talking with me. Oh my. In addition, he came unprepared. He didn't even bring his resume. Unacceptable. How about the second one? He has good attitude, but he doesn't have enough experience and knowledge for that position. He lacks confidence. I feel that his soft skills are also not good. What a pity. What will you do next? I don't know. I am going to have an interview this afternoon. It is a girl. Since the job is mainly for men, I don't have much hope. If I can't hire anyone until the end of the month, my boss will complain. You can do it. Thanks. If you need my help, let me know. I can help share your post on my social media. Sure. Thanks. Okay. Now, please tell me about yourself. I studied at New York University. I just moved here. I have five years of experience as a developer at two technology companies. I'm fluent in Java and JavaScript. Very good. You have many years of experience. So, why do you choose our company? I can see chances of developing myself to a higher level at your company. Where do you see yourself in the next five years? Well, in five years, I see myself as a valued senior developer in this company. After that, I hope I can be trained as a team leader. Great. Can you tell me about your strength? Hard working is my strength. I can work in a high pressure environment. Great. What about your weakness? I think I am not a social person. So, I always take more time to adapt to new colleagues. But I can try if you give me a chance. When can you start? If possible, I can start next week. I need to arrange my work in the current company. I'm so sorry if it causes any inconvenience. It is okay. Do you have any questions? I think I understand well about the position. I just want to know, when will I get the result of this interview? The result will be sent within five days. Great. Thanks. I hope to have the opportunity to work with you. So do I. Hi.
