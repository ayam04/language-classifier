Question number one. Okay, designing and implementing efficient secure database solutions using both SQL and no SQL technologies in the context of Python based application involves several steps. First is requirement analysis, second is database selection, third is database schema, fourth is security measures, fifth is implementation and by thumb, sixth is restful AP integration. And there is performance optimization, that's it. Next question. Next question. Traverse shooting and optimizing applications on a live based systems of performance reliability. Especially when working with Python and Django framework involves several strategies and tools. Here is a comprehensive approach, monitoring and logging, database optimization, indexing, query optimization, caching, then there are different caching strategies. We implement the caching strategy and concurrency and asynchronous does, then containerization and orchestration for example Docker Kubernetes, then security best patches using STPBS, STTBS and SSR certificates. And yeah, that's it.
