So, we use Zoho CRM software to ensure every request that we have received from customer and is documented. It is also thoroughly reviewed time to time, updating various status, usage of the product, complaints, feedbacks, all of that. For information accuracy, we used to have a team lead and the team lead will verify this data against other metrics by talking to customer and things like that. We had certain automation in place to ensure the data that we are entering matches to our expected criteria and if something looks out of place, it auto highlights to the team member. Some of the metrics that we track are the customer using our product, how often they come back. So, we look at weekly trend, monthly trends of a number of successful logins, bugs raised, tickets raised, how soon we are able to resolve those tickets, overall customer satisfaction, feedback to each of those tickets and each process had a line manager assigned to verify. If something has not been given a best rating by customer, why did it not happen? And if the trend looks going down for usage, then there is a flag raised. But if the number of issues are low, that's a good trend to track. So, we have created KPIs and individual leads were assigned accordingly. We often use our weekly review cycles for customer success teams apart from daily team meetings. But the weekly cycles are primarily focused on looking at these trends, identifying if there are any gaps and discuss various insights along with internal stakeholders.
