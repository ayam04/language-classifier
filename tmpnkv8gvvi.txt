I'll be asking questions on Python testing and code analysis tools. Can you explain the use of pilot and flake 8 and Python code analysis? So, pilot is a highly configurable linter for comprehensive error checking and customizable coding guidelines enforcement. And coming to flake 8, it's a inter-combining linter combining five flakes, five code style and make-able complexity analysis for quick quality assurance. Great attempt. You've captured some crucial elements in your response. There's another question I would like to ask you. Explain what coverage.py does in Python testing. Coming to coverage.py, it's a tool for measuring code coverage of Python program. It monitors your program and also notes which parts of the code have been executed. Then, analyze this source.
